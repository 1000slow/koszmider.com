text_title: 90's ads for cybersecurity company
text_content: During our collaboration with Tribe47, I had the opportunity to create ads for CQure, a cybersecurity company. Inspired by the vibrant and nostalgic atmosphere of the 90s, I infused the designs with a retro aesthetic that captured attention and conveyed a sense of nostalgia.<br><br>With attention to detail, I ensured that the ads maintained a balance between the retro elements and CQure's brand identity. These ads not only captured the audience's attention but also conveyed CQure's message of staying ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
