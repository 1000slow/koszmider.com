text_title: Ariel Modrzyk Website
text_content: With pleasure, I present the responsive website project for physiotherapist Ariel Modrzyk, which came to life through my first encounter with Elementor â€“ a powerful WordPress page builder. After creating the graphic design in Adobe XD, I decided to explore the capabilities of Elementor using only the free version. Thanks to its intuitive interface and flexible options, I was able to translate the concept for Mr. Modrzyk into the digital realm. This project not only offered me new experiences but also made me realize how quickly and efficiently one can create professional websites, even with the first encounter with this powerful tool. I take pride in the outcome and am ready for the next challenges.
