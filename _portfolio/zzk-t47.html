text_title: Ads with a touch of humour
text_content: During my collaboration with Tribe47 agency, I had the opportunity to create engaging and playful ads that involved illustrations and photo manipulations, most of it with a touch of humor.<br><br>The main objective of these ads was to captivate the audience's attention and pique their curiosity by infusing the visuals with a humorous twist and incorporating elements like grilling or pimp a LinkedIn profile. The designs successfully stood out from the competition and this unique approach evoked a sense of excitement and playfulness, ultimately encouraging viewers to take action.<br><br>The rest of the designs I choose to show here featured eye-catching graphic elements that seamlessly aligned with the brand's identity.
