text_title: 3D-Stuff Branding
text_content: In the branding project for 3D-Stuff, I aimed for creativity, precision, and a dynamic aesthetic. The name speaks for itself, and my task was to create a visual identity that perfectly reflects the innovation of this company.<br><br>The focal point of my design is an isometric projection solid, symbolizing three-dimensionality and advanced technology. The color scheme in shades of orange, white, and black infuses the project with energy and modernity while maintaining a professional character.<br><br>By combining these elements, I crafted a cohesive and distinctive branding that sets 3D-Stuff apart from the competition.
