text_content: In this practice, I transformed the fictional tech company Bootspace into a digital reality. Using Adobe XD, I crafted an intuitive and visually striking website. The addition of custom illustrations, hand-drawn on my iPad, brought the brand to life, creating a seamless blend of technology and creativity. This case study showcases the harmonious fusion of digital design and illustration, resulting in a memorable user experience that goes beyond the ordinary.
