            <p>Hello, I’m Gosia! More often than not I’m an observer - I look cautiously at the world around me, constantly searching for inspiration. My adventure with visual arts began when I was still a kid when the first computer appeared at home.</p>

            <p>My drive to create led me to an art school. Out of all my interests - from making movies, through drawing and painting to music production - I picked computer graphics and illustration as my career path.</p>

            <p>Communication is definitely one of the most important aspects of my work. When working with me you can expect my full commitment towards understanding the complete picture as I believe it’s a necessary foundation of satisfying and fruitful collaboration. This way I can draw from my creativity in order to help you accomplish your goal instead of just blindly following a set of instructions.</p>

            <p>I’m a sensitive person, but also a positive one. I always try to put a smile on another person’s face and because of that I pour all my heart into every project and make sure there’s a little bit of me in every finished piece.</p>
